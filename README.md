## Introduction

Whenever I log onto a website, I always wonder how people can manage and interact with each other through it. How every of my action gets respond so quickly. It is very interesting actually to learn how everything works "behind the scene". Creating a website of Tourism has always been my desire, since I used to work in hospitality before. 

In order to have good knowledge to create this project, I truly appreciate the website of The Official Tourism of Vietnam, which provides me great information, beautiful photos, and ideas. Besides, there are several nice photos that I have in this project, which are from other websites below.
