## Introduction

Whenever I log onto a website, I always wonder how people can manage and interact with each other through it. How every of my action gets respond so quickly. It is very interesting actually to learn how everything works "behind the scene". Creating a website of Tourism has always been my desire, since I used to work in hospitality before. 

In order to have good knowledge to create this project, I truly appreciate the website of The Official Tourism of Vietnam, which provides me great information, beautiful photos, and ideas. Besides, there are several nice photos that I have in this project, which are from other websites below.

## Instructions
There are 5 files in this projects, and we will focus mainly on `index.js` and `db.json`, which contain most of the learning goals.

* I started this project by creating a single page of `index.html`, and created `index.js` and `style.css` as well.
* Created a file `db.json`, and posted a collection of 5 objects with 4 attributes and named it "attractions".
* Starting with `index.js` by creating a <ul> tag with the className "card". I also created <img><h2><p><button> tags for all 4 attributes.
* Made GET request for the 5 objects through the function getAttractions().
* Created a click event through userFavorite() function. The heart will change from empty to full red heart and change back originally whenever users do the "click" action.
* I also made submit event as well. Whenever user submit their email, an alert message will be triggered.
* The third event listener is DOMContentLoaded event.

## Conclusion

To be honest, I feel amazing after I completed this project. There are so many materials that I have learned, and of course, it's been challenging. This project will only be the good start for me because I will keep studying and practicing to be come a real-deal developer!
